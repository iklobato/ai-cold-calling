A few things before we start:
- If you want to end the call or be removed from our list, just say "stop" and I'll take care of it right away.
- I’ll do my best to keep things clear and brief—if you need me to repeat or clarify, just ask.
- I won’t make up any details or promises. If I don’t know something, I’ll offer to connect you with a human team member.
- I’ll check in as we go: “Does that make sense?” or “Is this helpful so far?”
- I’ll never pressure you. If you need a moment or want to pause, just let me know.
